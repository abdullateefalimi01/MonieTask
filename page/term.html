        <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
        <p>
          MonieTask is a platform developed by Peak Tech, a Web Company located
          in Lagos. With MonieTask, you can easily advertise your products and
          services and also earn daily income by reposting adverts on your
          social media accounts. these terms will automatically apply to you –
          you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before
          using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the Web, any part
          of the Web, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to
          attempt to extract the source code of the Web, and you also shouldn’t
          try to translate the Web into other languages, or make derivative
          versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database
          rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still
          belong to Hawkit International Limited. MonieTask is committed to
          ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that
          reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge
          for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge
          you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you
          exactly what you’re paying for. The MonieTask app stores and processes
          personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide our
          Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the
          Web secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root
          your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and
          limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device.
          It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious
          programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean
          that the Hawkit app won’t work properly or at all. You should be aware
          that there are certain things that MonieTask International Limited
          will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will
          require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection
          can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Hawkit
          International Limited cannot take responsibility for the app not
          working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and
          you don’t have any of your data allowance left. If you’re using the
          app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms
          of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply.
          As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost
          of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
          other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
          responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if
          you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or
          country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill
          payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware
          that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer
          for using the app. Along the same lines, Hawkit International Limited
          cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You
          need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
          battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Hawkit
          International Limited cannot accept responsibility. With respect to
          MonieTask International Limited’s responsibility for your use of the
          app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that
          although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all
          times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so
          that we can make it available to you. Hawkit International Limited
          accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience
          as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app. At
          some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently
          available on Android & iOS – the requirements for both systems (and
          for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the
          app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you
          want to keep using the app. Hawkit International Limited does not
          promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to
          you and/or works with the Android & iOS version that you have
          installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept
          updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to
          stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time
          without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you
          otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted
          to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and
          (if needed) delete it from your device. Changes to This Terms and
          Conditions We may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time.
          Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any

          and Conditions on this page. These changes are effective immediately
